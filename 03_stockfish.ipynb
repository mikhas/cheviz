We're not building high-end desktop software here (does such thing even exist?) so hard-coding the download URL for just the Linux version is OK. It might feel wrong, but the best advice to counter your (very valid) intuition is that we have to focus on our goal: automated insights. That is, don't spend time over-engineering the basic, non-data-sciency stuff in your pipeline *unless* your pipeline is ready to run in production and earn money for you. There is a reason why we use Python for all of this, so quick'n'dirty – to a certain degree – is the way to go.\n",

    "PGN can be described as a hierarchical document model due to its ability to store variations next to the mainline. Python chess uses a recursive nodes structure to model PGN; `GameNode::add_main_variation(move: chess.Move)->GameNode` processes a move, adds it as a child to the current node and returns the child. If we only process the mainline moves, the structure effectively represents a linked list. We could also just use a chess.Board instance to replay the engine results back to Python chess. Since our data module handles PGN however, I thought I go the extra step here. The way engine, game and board interact feels fragile to me but that is perhaps because board isn't just a plain chess position viewer. Instead, it has game/engine logic of its own."
