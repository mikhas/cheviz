The actual engine is provided by Python chess as [described here](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html). However, in our goal to build a complete ETL pipeline, we still need to get the engine running on our box. In a similar way as we got our data (PGN-encoded chess games), I'd like to use Jupyter Notebooks to perform the engine integration."

    "Assuming this notebook runs on a Linux box, we'll get the Linux binary [from the official website](https://stockfishchess.org/download/). We're not building high-end desktop software here (does such thing even exist?) so hard-coding the download URL for just the Linux version is OK. It might feel wrong, but the best advice to counter your (very valid) intuition is that we have to focus on our goal: automated insights. That is, don't spend time over-engineering the basic, non-data-sciency stuff in your pipeline *unless* your pipeline is ready to run in production and earn money for you. There is a reason why we use Python for all of this, so quick'n'dirty – to a certain degree – is the way to go.\n",

Normally that's a sign you're doing something wrong at extra costs to someone else (in this case ISP hosting fees for the stockfish communiy). At 1.7M of download size, which is probably smaller than a typical project's landing page these days, I don't feel guilty at all."
